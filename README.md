## Our Question
Do you believe Minecraft has room for improvement or innovation? Have you ever envisioned features or mechanics that Mojang overlooked or dismissed? If so, we invite you to explore Project EaglecraftY, where your ideas can come to life in a fresh and exciting way.

## What is EaglecraftY?
EaglecraftY is a game inspired by Minecraft, developed by Xojang Studios ZB. It offers a fresh experience with an Industrial Revolution theme, featuring:

1. **New Blocks and Items**: Designed around industrial and modern concepts.
2. **Modular Design**: Allows for internal expansion and potential future mod support (details forthcoming).
3. **High Performance**:  We are utilizing [Engine Name] and focusing on efficient code to deliver a smooth and responsive gameplay experience, targeting high frame rates.
4. **Unique World Format (EWF)**: Ensures efficient saving and loading of chunks, providing compatibility and efficiency.

Explore a new world with innovative features and mechanics that push the boundaries of traditional gameplay.

## Why We Are Making This Project
We are creating EaglecraftY to address several critical issues we see in the current Minecraft ecosystem:

1. **Restrictive EULA**: The Minecraft End User License Agreement (EULA) has become increasingly restrictive, limiting the freedom of servers, modders, and content creators. [Source](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula)
2. **Hidden Clauses**: There have been accusations that Mojang hides clauses within their agreements, potentially exploiting their community. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/3d8y8k/mojangs_hidden_clauses/)
3. **Poor Moderation**: The Minecraft community has faced issues with poor moderation, leading to exploitation and the spread of inappropriate content. [Source](https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/24/18715589/minecraft-marketplace-moderation-issues)
4. **Microsoft's Acquisition**: Since Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang, there have been criticisms regarding anti-trust issues, mishandling of the game, and the introduction of microtransactions. [Source](https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/15/6152153/microsoft-buys-minecraft)
5. **Legal Concerns**: Mojang and Microsoft have faced accusations of breaking EU consumer laws, particularly in Sweden and the European Union. [Source](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-06-21-minecraft-eu-consumer-rights)
6. **Community Frustration**: Many players feel that Minecraft has become stagnant, repetitive, and overly commercialized, losing the innovative spirit it once had.

By creating EaglecraftY, we aim to provide a fresh, innovative experience that addresses these concerns and empowers the community.

## Our Theme: Industrial Revolution
Minecraft's current Medieval theme can feel outdated and limiting. We chose the Industrial Revolution theme for EaglecraftY to introduce a modern, dynamic, and expansive gameplay experience. This theme allows us to incorporate advanced machinery, new technologies, and a sense of progress and innovation.

### New Blocks
- **Gears**: Essential for creating complex machinery.
- **Ruby Ore**: A new resource for crafting and trading.
- **Crying Obsidian**: Adds new aesthetic and functional possibilities.
- **Nether Reactor Core**: Unlocks powerful new mechanics.
- **And more!**

### New Mechanics
- **Red Dragons**: Tameable and rideable, adding a new dimension to exploration and combat.
- **Friendly Withers**: A twist on the classic enemy, now an ally.
- **Thirst Bar**: Adds a new survival challenge, requiring players to manage hydration.

### New Dimensions
- **Sky Dimension**: Offers endless exploration above the clouds.
- **Farlands**: A mysterious and challenging new area to discover.

## Notch's Original Ideas
We also draw inspiration from some of Notch's original plans for Minecraft that were never fully realized:

- **Skylands**: An expansive floating island biome, offering unique challenges and resources.
- **Red Dragons**: Initially planned as a counterpart to the Ender Dragon, providing new combat experiences.
- **Crying Obsidian**: Originally intended as a spawn point block, now reimagined with new functionalities.
- **Ruby Ore**: Once considered as a currency, now a valuable resource for crafting and trading.

By incorporating these ideas, we aim to honor the original vision of Minecraft while pushing the boundaries with our own innovations.

### No Build Height Limit
Build as high as you want without any restrictions, unleashing your creativity.

By embracing the Industrial Revolution theme, we aim to push the boundaries of traditional gameplay and offer players a unique and engaging experience.

## Our Vision
We aim to create a game that:

- **Empowers the Community**:  We are exploring options for community involvement and feedback.
- **Delivers Performance**: Our engine is optimized for smooth gameplay.
- **Respects Creativity**: No hardcoded world borders or restrictive mechanics.
- **Honors Minecraft's Legacy**: We are inspired by Minecraft's early vision.
- **Innovates Boldly**: We are introducing new features and mechanics.

By adhering to these principles, we strive to build a better formula for a sandbox game, inspired by the original spirit of Minecraft.
