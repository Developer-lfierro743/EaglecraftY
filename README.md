Welcome to Project EaglecraftY!
Developed by Xojang Studios ZB
Our Question?
Do you feel that Minecraft has become stagnant, repetitive, or overly restrictive? Have you ever had ideas for Minecraft that Mojang never heard or rejected? If so, Project EaglecraftY is here to offer a fresh and innovative alternative.

What is EaglecraftY?
EaglecraftY is a Minecraft-inspired game developed by Xojang Studios ZB. It aims to provide a new and exciting experience with a theme inspired by the Industrial Revolution. This means:

All-new blocks, items, and mechanics designed around industrial and modern concepts.

A modular codebase for easy expansion and customization.

A performance-focused engine that delivers +400 FPS without the need for optimization mods.

A unique world format (EWF) for saving and loading chunks, ensuring compatibility and efficiency.

Why We Are Making This Project
We have several reasons for creating EaglecraftY:

Restrictive EULA: The Minecraft EULA has become overly restrictive for servers, modders, and content creators.

Hidden Clauses: Mojang has been accused of hiding clauses and exploiting its community.

Bad Moderation: Poor moderation practices have led to exploitation and inappropriate content in the Minecraft community.

Microsoft Mishandling: Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang has been criticized for anti-trust issues, mishandling, and microtransactions.

Legal Issues: Mojang and Microsoft have been accused of breaking EU consumer laws, particularly in Sweden and the European Union.

Community Frustration: Many players feel that Minecraft has become stagnant, repetitive, and overly commercialized.

Our Theme: Industrial Revolution
The current theme of Minecraft is Medieval, which is outdated and limiting. EaglecraftY introduces a modern Industrial Revolution theme, featuring:

New Blocks: Gears, Ruby ore, Crying Obsidian, Nether Reactor Core, and more.

New Mechanics: Red Dragons (tameable and ridable), Friendly Withers, and a thirst bar.

New Dimensions: A Sky Dimension and Farlands for endless exploration.

No Build Height Limit: Build as high as you want without restrictions.

Our Vision
We aim to create a game that:

Empowers the Community: With an open-source modding API, players can create and share mods freely.

Delivers Performance: Our engine is optimized to run at +400 FPS, even on lower-end devices.

Respects Creativity: No hardcoded world borders or restrictive mechanics.

Challenges Mojang: We are not afraid to innovate and push the boundaries of what a Minecraft-inspired game can be.
