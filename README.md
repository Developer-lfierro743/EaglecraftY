## A Fresh Take on Sandbox Gaming

EaglecraftY offers a unique sandbox experience, inspired by Minecraft but with a fresh vision.  We're building a world set during the Industrial Revolution, filled with innovation and exciting new possibilities.

## Core Features

* **Industrial Revolution Setting:** Explore a world of gears, machinery, and technological marvels.
* **High-Performance Gameplay:** Experience smooth, high-FPS action.
* **Unique World Format (EWF):**  Our custom world format expands gameplay possibilities.
* **Community Focus:** Your feedback is crucial to our development.

## What Sets Us Apart

We draw inspiration from Notch's original Minecraft vision, incorporating elements that never fully materialized, alongside entirely new features:

* **New Blocks & Items:** Gears, ruby ore, crying obsidian, and more!
* **Innovative Mechanics:** Tameable red dragons, friendly withers, a thirst system, and much more.
* **Expanded Dimensions:** Explore the Sky Dimension and the mysterious Farlands.

## Our Vision

We aim to create a game that's:

* **Community-driven:** Your feedback shapes our development.
* **High-performing:** Smooth and engaging gameplay.
* **Creative:**  Unrestricted building and exploration.
* **Innovative:** Pushing the boundaries of the sandbox genre.
