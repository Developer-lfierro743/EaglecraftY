## Have You Ever Wondered...?

Do you feel like Minecraft could use more innovation? Have you ever had ideas for the game that Mojang overlooked, dismissed, or rejected? If so, you're in the right place! **Project EaglecraftY** is here to bring those ideas to life. We’re creating a space where creativity thrives, and your ideas can shine. Plus, we’re incorporating some of Notch’s original concepts and rejected ideas, along with a ton of new features!

## What is EaglecraftY?
>EaglecraftY is a game inspired by Minecraft, developed by **Xojang Studios ZB**. It’s a fresh take on the sandbox genre, with a brand-new theme: **The Industrial Revolution**. We believe Minecraft’s medieval theme is outdated, so we’re upgrading to a more modern and innovative setting.

### Key Features:  
- **New Blocks and Items**: Designed around industrial and modern concepts, including some of Minecraft’s rejected ideas.  
- **Modular Design**: Say goodbye to messy code! Our game is built to be easily modded and updated.  
- **High Performance**: Enjoy buttery-smooth gameplay with the potential to reach **400+ FPS**—way beyond Minecraft’s current limits.  
- **Unique World Format (EWF)**: Our **EaglecraftY World Format (EWF)** pushes the boundaries of exploration and gameplay, offering a fresh experience compared to Minecraft’s traditional world format.  

## Why Are We Making EaglecraftY?

We’re creating EaglecraftY to address several critical issues in the current Minecraft ecosystem:  

1. **Restrictive EULA**: Minecraft’s End User License Agreement (EULA) has become too limiting for servers, modders, and content creators.  
2. **Hidden Clauses**: There are concerns that Mojang hides clauses in their agreements, potentially exploiting their community.  
3. **Poor Moderation**: The Minecraft community has struggled with inadequate moderation, leading to exploitation and inappropriate content.  
4. **Microsoft’s Acquisition**: Since Microsoft took over Mojang, there have been criticisms about anti-trust issues, mishandling of the game, and the introduction of microtransactions.  
5. **Legal Concerns**: Mojang and Microsoft have been accused of breaking EU consumer laws.  
6. **Stagnation**: Many players feel Minecraft has become repetitive and overly commercialized, losing its innovative spirit.  

EaglecraftY is our answer to these problems. We’re building a game that empowers the community, respects creativity, and pushes the boundaries of what a sandbox game can be.

## Why the Industrial Revolution Theme?
> Minecraft’s medieval theme feels outdated to us, so we’re embracing the **Industrial Revolution** as our main theme. It’s a perfect fit for innovation, machinery, and modern concepts.  

### New Blocks:  
- **Gears**: Essential for building complex machinery.  
- **Ruby Ore**: A valuable resource for crafting and trading.  
- **Crying Obsidian**: Adds new aesthetic and functional possibilities.  
- **Nether Reactor Core**: Unlocks powerful new mechanics.  
- **And more!**  

### New Mechanics:  
- **Red Dragons**: Tameable and rideable, adding a new layer to exploration and combat.  
- **Friendly Withers**: A twist on the classic enemy—now they’re your allies!  
- **Thirst Bar**: A new survival challenge that requires players to manage hydration.  

### New Dimensions:  
- **Sky Dimension**: Explore endless skies above the clouds.  
- **Farlands**: A mysterious and challenging new area to discover.  

## Honoring Notch’s Original Vision
> We’re also drawing inspiration from some of Notch’s original ideas for Minecraft that were never fully realized:  
- **Red Dragons**: Initially planned as a counterpart to the Ender Dragon.  
- **Crying Obsidian**: Originally intended as a spawn point block.  
- **Ruby Ore**: Once considered as a currency.  

By incorporating these ideas, we’re paying homage to Minecraft’s roots while adding our own unique spin.

## No Build Height Limit
Build as high as you want! There are no restrictions on build height, so your creativity can truly soar.

## Our Vision
We aim to create a game that:  
- **Empowers the Community**: Your feedback and ideas matter.  
- **Delivers Performance**: Smooth gameplay with high FPS.  
- **Respects Creativity**: No hardcoded world borders or restrictive mechanics.  
- **Honors Minecraft’s Legacy**: Inspired by the original spirit of Minecraft.  
- **Innovates Boldly**: Introducing new features and mechanics to push the boundaries of sandbox gaming.
